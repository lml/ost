# USAGE
###############################################################################
#
# Each entry in this file consists of one line containing a perl regular
# expression (regex) and a Licenser name.  The last token on a line is 
# considered to be the Licenser name. 
#
# Whitespace at the beginning and end of a line and between the regex and the 
# Licenser name is ignored.
#
# Text after a '#' symbol is considered a comment and is ignored.
#
# Blank lines are ignored.
#
# For each filename being processed, this file is scanned from top to bottom.
# The first regex matching the filename causes the associated Licenser to
# apply the license to that file.
#
# All lines in license.txt are commented.  Note, however, that each Licenser
# adds additional blank lines between the license text and the file contents as
# appropriate.
#
# The exact list of supported Licenser names is determined by the perl
# modules matching the pattern "*Licenser.pm" in the script directory.  The
# name of a Licenser is the part of the filename matching the '*'.  Some of
# the currently supported Licenser names are:
#
#    Coffee        prepend "# " to each line
#    Css           use '/* ... */' delimiters before first and after last lines
#                  and prefix each line with ' * '
#    Erb           use '<%# ... %>' delimiters on first and last lines
#    JavsScript    prepend '// ' to each line
#    Latex         prepend '% ' to each line
#    Noop          do not apply the license to the file
#    PerlModule    prepend '# ' to each line
#    Ruby          prepend '# ' to each line
#    Rake          prepend '# ' to each line
#    Script        prepend '# ' to each line; insert after first line of file
#    Scss          prepend '// ' to each line
#    Text          prepend '# ' to each line
#    Yaml          prepend '# ' to each line

<p><strong>Learning conditions</strong> are rules that define how <%= SITE_NAME %> builds assignments. You have the option to use the default learning conditions, <em><strong>or</strong></em> you 
  can create custom conditions.</p>
  <p>Whether you use default or custom conditions, we strongly recommend browsing this tutorial to learn how learning conditions impact your assignments.</p>

   <%= accordion_entry :title => "Overview of learning conditions" do %>
   <p>Learning conditions are customizable rules that control how OST builds assignments. There are two (2) kinds of learning conditions:</p> 
  <ol>
      <li><strong>Schedule conditions</strong> control how OST builds and schedules
         homework (<em>not</em> test) assignments.</li>
      <p>
      <li><strong>Feedback conditions</strong> control how and when OST presents feedback after students work homework and tests exercises.</li>
    </ol>
    
  <p>You have the option to simply use the default learning conditions (described in more detail below), or you can create custom conditions to exert more 
    control over your students' experiences in OST.</p> 
    
   <% end %>

    <%= accordion_entry :title => "The default learning conditions" do %>

      <p>OST automatically creates default learning conditions for each class. <em>Unless you change these conditions or create new conditions, 
        OST will build your assignments according to the default conditions below</em>.</p>

      <p>By default, a class comprises one (1) <strong>cohort</strong>. <em>A cohort is a group of students whose assignments are built using the same learning conditions</em>. 
        The default setting should meet most instructors' needs.</p>

  <%= accordion_entry :title => "Overview of schedule conditions" do %>
  
  <p>Schedule conditions define the following aspects of homework assignments (<em>not</em> tests):</p>
  
    <ol>
      <li>Given that you create homework assignments by listing a topic or topics, <em>how many</em> <em>exercises</em> from each topic will be in each homework?</li>
      <p>
      <li>Will homework include exercises from <em>previous topics</em> to give students <%= link_to_help 'spaced_practice', text="spaced practice", {:title => 'Spaced practice', 
            :width => '500', :height => '500'} %> ?</li>
      <p>
      <li>Are the above rules consistently applied to every assignment, or do they vary from homework to homework?</li>
      <p>  
      <li>What, if any, labels should OST attach to each homework exercise?</li> 
      <p>
    </ol>
          
    <% end %>
    <%= accordion_entry :title => "Default schedule condition" do %>
    
 <p><strong>By default, OST will build homework assignments using the default schedule condition described below</strong>. If you don't want to use the default, consult the below tutorials 
   to create a custom condition.</p>

<p><strong>Default schedule condition</strong>:</p>
       <p><%= image_tag("default_schedule.png", {:border => 1, :width => "100%", :title=>"schedule"})%></p>
         <ol>
           <li>Class has <em>one cohort</em>: All students in the class will receive the same assignment schedule.</li>
           <p>
           <li>Class has one <em>schedule</em>: Each homework assignment is built using the same percentage rule.</li>
           <p>
           <li><em>Percentage rule</em>: OST will pull <em>100%</em> of <strong>non-test</strong> exercises from each 
             topic added to an assignment.</li>
           <p>
           <li><em>Labels</em>: OST attaches the label <em>standard practice</em> to each <strong>non-test</strong> 
           exercise.</li>
         </ol>
  <% end %>
  
  <%= accordion_entry :title => "How to create a spaced practice schedule condition " do%>
  <p>For example, you can create a schedule condition to automatically space topic practice across multiple assignments.</p>
     
    you can define  how many exercises each assignment includes rules define whether OST should pull 
    all the exercises from a topic into an assignment, or some pre-set percentage.  
    custom <em><strong>schedule conditions</strong></em> that define how OST will build and schedule your homework assignments.</p>

   <em><p>Step 1: Create new feedback condition.</p></em>
   <ol>
     <li>Go to <strong>Dashboard > Class > Learning Conditions</strong>.</li>
     <li>In the Feedback Conditions section, click <strong>Add New Feedback Condition</strong>.</li>
     <li>In the pop up dialog box, select <strong>Basic</strong> feedback condition and 
       click <strong>Choose</strong>.</li>
     <li>You have just created an empty feedback condition.</li>
   </ol>

   <p><em>Step 2: Edit feedback condition.</em></p>
     <ol>
     <li>Find the feedback condition you want to edit and click <strong>Edit</strong>.</li> 
       <%= image_tag("feedback7.png", {:border => 1, :width => "70%", :height => "70%",

           match the label of the exercise(s) you want to receive this feedback condition.

         <li><strong>Feedback presentation field</strong>: check this feedback presentation 
           box to show students feedback automatically, or leave it unchecked to make students 
           manually click on feedback page to view.</li>

   <%= accordion_entry :title => "Use labels to control feedback conditions" do %>
   
   Use labels to control when the site applies feedback conditions
   <p> must specify which feedback conditions apply to what exercises.
     <ol>
       <li>Create a feedback condition and assign it some arbitrary label.</li>
       <li>Attach that same feedback label to <em>all exercises you want to receive that
          feedback condition</em><br/></li>
      <li>Each additional feedback condition you create should have a different label.</li> 
     </ol>

   <p>When a student completes an exercise, <%= SITE_NAME %> looks at the exercise labels 
     and searches for a matching feedback condition label. When a matching feedback condition
      is found, its rules are used to determine how feedback is given. </p>

   <ul>
   </li><strong>Example 1</strong>: if a student completes an exercise labeled 
   <em>Homework</em>, and there is a feedback condition labeled <em>Homework</em>, 
   <%= SITE_NAME %> will apply the <em>Homework</em> feedback condition to that exercise.</li>
   <p>
   </li><strong>Example 2</strong>: if a student completes an exercise labeled 
   <em>Test</em>, and there is no feedback condition matching that exercise label,
    <%= SITE_NAME %> cannot apply a feedback condition. The student will <em><strong>not</strong></em>
     receive feedback for that exercise.</li>
   <p>
   </ul>
   <% end %>
   
   <%= accordion_entry :title => "Attach feedback labels to exercises or assignments" do %>
   <p>Once you have set the feedback conditions for your class, make sure that you attach 
     matching labels to the exercises each feedback condition will be applied to.</p>

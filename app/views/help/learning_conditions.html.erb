  <p>Learning conditions are customizable rules that let you 
     control important aspects of your students' experiences 
      in OpenStax Tutor. Select from the help topics below. We 
      recommend you start with the overview.</p>

  <p><i>Are you an educator participating in a research study?</i> If so, the research team will set up  
          learning conditions on your behalf. To preserve a firewall between researcher and educator, you will not be

        <p>Learning conditions are customizable rules that enable you 
          to schedule actions to occur automatically. 
          Using learning conditions, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Automatically release feedback when certain conditions are met</li>
            <li>Customize timing and type of feedback for different assignments (e.g., 
          homeworks vs tests)</li>
            <li>Control whether your multiple-choice exercises contain a free-form 
                component</li>
            <li>Automate how your homework is built.</li>
        </ul>

          <ul>
            <li><b>Set up the Scheduler</b>: For each topic you 
              assign as homework, the Scheduler defines <em>what percentage of 
              those exercises are added</em> 
              to a particular assignment. You must 
              have a Scheduler in place. It will be applied automatically 
              to all homework assignments.</li>
            <p>
            <li><b>Create feedback conditions</b>: Feedback conditions
                let you control how, when, and what 
                kind of <%= link_to_help 'example_feedback', text="feedback",

            <p>
            <li><b>Create presentation conditions</b>: Presentation conditions
               let you control whether or not 
               multiple-choice exercises include 
               a <%= link_to_help 'question_format', text="a free-form component",

            <p>
            <li><b>Attach feedback and/or presentation labels to assignments</b>:
                Once you create feedback and presentation conditions, you need to 
                specify when you want them to be activated. You'll do this by attaching 
                labels to exercises. When assignments are built, each exercise's labels 
                are matched against the existing feedback and presentation conditions.

           <p>The default Scheduler would build your homework as follows:</p>
            <ol>
               <li>Your homework will include 100% of the <i>unused</i> homework 
                   questions, i.e., the 2 questions reserved 
                   for homework and not those marked as test questions.</li>
               <p>
               <li>The label <i>standard practice</i> will be applied to each exercise.
              </li>
            </ol>
          <p>You can verify this by going to Learning Plan, then clicking <b>Preview Assignments</b>. 
             Preview mode shows what questions were added to a homework by the Scheduler, as well as 
             any labels attached to each exercise.</p>

          <p>While the default Scheduler will be applicable to many classes, you may 
            want to create a custom Scheduler. This can be as simple as changing the labels 
            the Scheduler automatically applies to each exercise. But the Scheduler also 
            supports more complicated rules, such as multiple schedules or automatically

            exercises? If so, under <b>Labels to apply</b>, enter comma-separated 
            labels that match the name of

        <li>Do you want the Scheduler to automatically pull in exercises
            from topics assigned in the previous assignment (n=1 homeworks ago)? If yes, 
            proceed to the next step. If not, go to step 10 below.</li>
                     <p>
        <li>To set up the Scheduler to automatically add exercises from previously assigned

        <li>In the second row (<i>n = 1 assignment ago</i>), under 
            <b>Percent to draw</b>, enter an integer between 0 and 100. 
            This number represents the percentage of exercises the Scheduler will
            draw from each topic you added to the <u>previous</u> homework 
            assignment. <b>Tip</b>: The Scheduler will ignore any previously 
            assigned exercises and those reserved for tests.</li>

             <p>
        <li>Again, if you want to automatically apply a specific feedback condition and/or 
           presentation condition to <i>these</i> exercises, enter comma-separated labels 
           that match the name of the condition(s) you wish to activate.</li>

        <li>Continue adding rows until you have built your custom Scheduler as desired.</li>
            <p>
        <li>Finally, you have the option to create additional Schedules. 
          If you create more than one schedule, your 
            Scheduler will cycle through each in sequence. For example,
             with 3 schedules, the Scheduler would 
            build HW 1 according to Schedule 1, HW 2 according 
            to Schedule 2, HW 3 according to Schedule 3, and HW 4 
            according to schedule 1. 
            If <u>yes</u>, proceed to the next step. Else, proceed
            to step 12.</li>
            <p>
        <li>To create another schedule, simply click <b>Add new 
            Schedule</b> and complete it following the instructions 
            above.</li>

          <li>If you have more than one feedback 
              condition and/or more than one 
              presentation condition, re-order them
              so that the condition

        </ol>
          <p>When your assignment is built, each exercise's labels
             are matched against your feedback and presentation 
             conditions. If/when a matching condition is found,

             exercise.</p>
         </p>
        <p>The below help tutorials will explain how to create conditions,

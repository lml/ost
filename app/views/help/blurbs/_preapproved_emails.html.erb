<p>By default, instructors must manually approve all student registration requests.</p>

<p>If you prefer, you may use one of the below methods to automatically approve registration requests:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Enter one student email address per line, e.g. </p>
<p>
<pre>michael@college.edu
ali@college.edu</pre>

<p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Enter email domain in below format to approve <em>any</em> 
  user in that domain, e.g.</p>
<p>
<pre>@domain.edu$
@math.college.edu$</pre>

<p>Note that if a student registers using a different email address or domain than that 
  listed here, OST will <em>not</em> automatically approve the request.</p>

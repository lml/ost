<p>Currently, OST supports <%= link_to "simple multiple choice questions", 
"https://quadbase.org/help/authoring#simple" %>.</p>
<p> When students work on a multiple choice question, 
they are given the opportunity to enter a free-form response. Once they 
lock in free-form work, they are shown multiple choice answer options. 
The instructor can view both free form work and answer choice.</p> 

<p>More question types will be supported soon, including matching questions,
   multipart questions and open ended questions.</p>

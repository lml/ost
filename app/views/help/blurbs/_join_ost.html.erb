<p><strong>Tips when creating an account</strong> -- might be good to add this info to the Join Now page, actually</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Use your real first and last name</em>. Your name will not be publicly available, but your instructor may see your name for grading purposes. Once you register, you  <strong>cannot</strong> edit your first and last name.</li>
  <li><em>Register an email address that you actively use and access</em>. OST uses the email you enter to confirm your new account and to send you important notifications.</li></li>
  <li><em>Enter the correct time zone.</em> OST uses your time zone to show assignment due dates and times.</li>
</ul>

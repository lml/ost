<p><%= SITE_NAME %> is built to capitalize on the large universe of freely available open educational resources (OER) but does not itself host educational content.</p>

<p>To assign exercises in OST, you must add your course materials to external OER repositories, or search for reusable OER content to use or adapt. For example, you can embed resources from <%= link_to "Connexions", 
  "http://www.cnx.org" %> and exercises from our OST-compatible OER repository. Please email <%= email_link "support", "support@openstaxtutor.org" %> for more information about the repository for exercises and assessments.</p>

         <li><em>Exercises</em> you use must be hosted on <%= link_to "Quadbase", "http://www.quadbase.org"%>, the open-access question and answer repository. 
               <strong>Currently, OST supports simple multiple choice questions only</strong>; more question types are coming soon.</li>

          <li><em>Study Resources</em> can be hosted on various external

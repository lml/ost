<p><%= SITE_NAME %> does not host course materials.</em> Accordingly, before assigning 
  resources and exercises via <%= SITE_NAME %>, your 
  course materials must be hosted on external websites. </p>
    <p>
    You can assign two (2) kinds of material in <%= SITE_NAME %>: 
       <ol>
          <li> <em>Study Resources</em>, which must be hosted on an external website such as <%= link_to "Connexions", 
          "http://www.cnx.org" %> or other website. Resources can include Connexions modules or other text, video, etc.</li>
          <p>
          <li> <em>Exercises</em>, which must be hosted on <%= link_to "Quadbase", "http://www.quadbase.org" 
          %>. Currently OST supports simple multiple choice exercises. More question types 
          will be supported soon.</li>
       </ol>
       <p>
      Content in Connexions and Quadbase is open and free to use or reuse. Similarly, 
      content you add to Connexions and Quadbase is easily shared -- allowing others to use
       and reuse it legally -- while still giving you recognition and attribution for your work.</li>

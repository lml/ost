<p>Before adding any content to <%= SITE_NAME %>, take some time to plan how you will organize your materials into topics.</p> 

<p>To organize your content into topics, consider the following: </p>

<ul>
    <li>In OST, a topic is a group of related exercises and resources. Ultimately, you will assign a topic, or multiple topics, as homework.</li>
    <p>    
      <li>Group all course materials related to an overarching topic together: for example, a topic called Signal Basics would include all <strong>resources</strong>, <strong>homework problems</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>test problems</strong> related to Signal Basics.</li>
      <p>
    <li>A typical engineering class has 10-15 topics, but you can have as many or as few as you like.</li>
    <p>
    <li>What are the overarching topics taught in your course? What homework/test exercises reinforce each topic? What is the logical sequence of your topics? </li>
    <p>

    <p>
</ul>

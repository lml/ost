<p>If you haven't received a confirmation email with an activation link, 
	here are the most common reasons it may not have arrived:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Emails may be trapped by your spam or junk filter</b>. 
    	Check your junk or spam folder. If the email is there, please make 
    	sure that emails from <i>@openstaxtutor.org</i> are not being marked as spam.</li>
    </li>
      <p>
    <li><b>You may have typed the wrong email address when you signed up.</b>
     No worries, this happens all the time. Just 
     <%= link_to "sign up again", new_user_registration_path, :target => '_blank'  %>.</b></li> 
    </ol>
 <p>Still having problems? Go to the OpenStax Tutor login page and 
 	<%= link_to "request the activation email be resent", new_user_confirmation_path, :target => '_blank'  %>.
 	 If that fails, it is possible that your server or ISP is blocking our emails. 
  You may want to try creating a new account with a different email address, such as a 
  Gmail address. If you need further help, please email the support team at 
  <%= email_link "support", "support@openstaxtutor.org" %>.</p>

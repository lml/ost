      <p>While OpenStax Tutor gives you several ways to show your work directly in the browser, sometimes that

      <p>If you have a smart device at your disposal, we make it really easy to upload free-form work directly from your smart phone or tablet.</p>

      <p>To see us walk through the process step by step, check out the below video tutorial.</p>

    <%= accordion_entry :title => "Can I still get credit if I work exercises 
    after the due date?" do %>
      <p><%= SITE_NAME %> will not give credit for answers entered after the due 
        date. However, final decisions about credit for late work are ultimately up 
        to your instructor.</p>          
    <% end %>
    
    <%= accordion_entry :title => "I made a mistake in my assignment. Can I 
    fix my work and get credit?" do %>
      <p>It depends. If you saved but did <em>not</em> lock your answer, you can 
        change your work anytime before the assignment due date.</p> 
      <p>However, if you <em>saved and locked</em> your free form or multiple
         choice answer, you cannot go back and change your answer.</p>
      <p>If you unintentionally entered the wrong multiple choice answer, but 
        your free form work reflects the correct multiple choice answer, 
        you may want to check your instructor's syllabus about their policy. 
        Final decisions about 
        grades are always up to the instructor.</p>

    <p>Note: Exercises you assign in OST must be hosted in the OST-compatible repository for assessments. You can add your own exercises or search for and adapt existing materials. Email <%= email_link "support", "support@openstaxtutor.org" %> for more information.</p>

    <p><%= SITE_NAME %> is built to capitalize on the large universe of open educational resources 
      (OER) but does not itself host educational content. You can add your own course materials to external websites, or 
      search particular OER repositories for reusable content to use, adapt, or remix.</p>

        <p>Once your materials are hosted on external sites, you can copy
           and paste the URL in the Topics section.</p>

      <p>If you are participating in a research study, <em><strong>check with
         the research team</strong></em> before moving a student to another 
         section, as it may impact the student's assignments.</p>

      <p>At this time, there is not a way to override points taken away due to 
        lateness or failure to view mandatory feedback. These features are coming soon.
         However, you can make a wrong answer correct by following these steps:</p>

      <p>You may be able to edit the exercise in Quadbase and then use the <strong>Refresh

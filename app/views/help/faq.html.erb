      <p>Working a hybrid free response and multiple choice question is a multi-step process.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Review the question stem, work the problem, and turn in your free-form work.</li>
          <p><i>Once you've turned in your free-form work, you cannot make changes to it.</i><p>
          <li>After you have turned in your free-form work, OST will show the multiple choice options. Choose the answer 
            that best corresponds to your free-form work. Submit.</li> 
        </ol>
    <% end %>


    <%= accordion_entry :title => "Can I still get credit if I work exercises 
    after the due date?" do %>
      <p><%= SITE_NAME %> will not give credit for answers entered after the due 
        date. However, final decisions about credit for late work are ultimately up 
        to your instructor.</p>          
    <% end %>
    
    <%= accordion_entry :title => "I made a mistake in an exercise. Can I 
    fix my work and get credit?" do %>
      <p>It depends.</P>
      <p>If you have saved free-form work, but haven't yet turned in your work, you can edit your answers anytime before 
      the assignment due date.</p> 
      <p>However, once you have turned in your free-form work or submitted your final multiple choice answer, you cannot 
      go back and change your answers. 
      <p>If you unintentionally entered the wrong multiple choice answer, but 
        your free form work reflects the correct multiple choice answer, 
        you may want to check your instructor's syllabus about their policy. 
        Final decisions about 
        grades are always up to the instructor.</p>

    <p><%= SITE_NAME %> is built to capitalize on the large universe of open educational resources

      search particular OER repositories for reusable content to use, adapt, or remix.</p>

        <p>Once your materials are hosted on external sites, you can copy

      <p>If you are participating in a research study, <em><strong>check with

      <p>At this time, there is not a way to override points taken away due to

<div class="sectionHeading" id="email_confirmation"><strong>I created an account but never received a registration confirmation email. What should I do?</strong></div>

<%= render :partial => 'help/blurbs/request_conf_email'%>

<div class ="sectionHeading" id="update_settings"><strong>How do I update my user settings, e.g. change my password / email address / time zone?</strong></div>
<p>Sign in and click <strong>My Account</strong>, found at the top of every page.</p>
<p>In My Account, you can update your password, email address and time zone. After you enter new information, enter your current password to confirm the changes.</p>

<div class="sectionHeading" id="forgot_password"><strong>It's been awhile and I forgot my password. Can I reset it?</strong></div>

<p>Sure. <%= link_to "Go here to reset your password.", new_user_password_path %></p>

<div class ="SectionHeading" id="change_section"><strong>I registered for the wrong section. How do I change to a different section?</strong></div
<p>
<p>If the instructor hasn't approved your registration request, you can change it yourself:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Go to <strong>Dashboard > Class name > Class Information</strong>.</li>
    <li>If your request is still pending, you will see the option to <strong>Cancel my request to join this class</strong>. Click Cancel and confirm your choice.</li>
    <li>On the same page, click <strong>Register</strong> to submit a new registration request for the correct section.</li>
  </ul>
    
<p>If you do <strong><em>not</em></strong> see Cancel my request to join this class, email the instructor and ask him/her to switch you to a different section.</p> 

<div class ="SectionHeading" id="multiple_choice"> <strong>I saved a free-form response, so why can't I view the multiple choice answers?</strong></div>

<p>In order to view the multiple choice answers, you must save and <em><strong>lock</strong></em> your free form response. If you save but don't lock your free form answer, you can work on other exercises or return to the assignment later, but you won't be able to view the multiple choice answers until you save and lock.</p>

<div class ="SectionHeading" id="late"><strong>I finished my assignment late. Can I still get credit if I work the exercises after the due date?</strong></div>

<p><%= SITE_NAME %> will not give credit for answers entered after the due date. However, final decisions about grading are ultimately up to your instructor.</p>

<div class="SectionHeading" id="fix_work"><strong>My hand slipped and I accidentally entered the wrong answer. Can I go back and fix my work?</strong></div>

<p>It depends. If you were working on the free form portion, and you saved but did <em>not</em> lock your answer, you can go back and update your work.</p> 

<p>If you <em>saved and locked</em> your answer, you cannot go back and change your answer. Similarly, if <em>you saved and locked</em> your multiple choice answer, you cannot go back and change your answer.</p>

<p>Final decisions about grading are always up to your instructor.</p>

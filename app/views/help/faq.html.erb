                                  see the multiple choice answers?" do %>
      <p>To view the multiple choice answers, you must save and 
        <em><strong>lock</strong></em> your free form response.</p>
        
      <p>If you save but
         <em><strong>don't lock</strong></em> your free form answer, you can work

    <%= accordion_entry :title => "Can I still get credit if I work exercises

      <p><%= SITE_NAME %> will not give credit for answers entered after the due 
        date. However, final decisions about credit for late work are ultimately up 
        to your instructor.</p>          
    <% end %>

    <%= accordion_entry :title => "I made a mistake in my assignment. Can I 
    fix my work and get credit?" do %>
      <p>It depends. If you saved but did <em>not</em> lock your answer, you can 
        change your work anytime before the assignment due date.</p> 
      <p>However, if you <em>saved and locked</em> your free form or multiple
         choice answer, you cannot go back and change your answer.</p>
      <p>If you unintentionally entered the wrong multiple choice answer, but 
        your free form work reflects the correct multiple choice answer, 
        you may want to check your instructor's syllabus about their policy. 
        Final decisions about 
        grades are always up to the instructor.</p>

  <%= section "Test Section", {:classes => 'first no_bar'} do %>
    <%= accordion_entry :title => "I created an account but never received a 
                 confirmation email. What should I do?" do %>
      <%= render :partial => 'help/blurbs/request_conf_email'%>
   <% end %>

   <%= accordion_entry :title => "How do I update my user settings, e.g. change my 
                  password / email address / time zone?" do %>    
      <ol>
        <li>Sign in and click <strong>My Account</strong>, found in the upper right 
            of every page, next to the welcome message.</li>
        <li>In My Account, update your password, email address and/or time zone.</li>
        <li>Enter your current password to confirm changes.</li>
      </ol>  
    <% end %>

    <%= accordion_entry :title => "I registered for the wrong section of my class. How do I change to a different section?" do %>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to <strong>Dashboard > Class name > Class Information</strong>.</li>
        <li>If you see <strong>Drop this class</strong>: don't drop the class. You need to email your instructor/TA to change your section.</li>
        <%= image_tag("dropthisclass.png", {:border => 1, :width => "90%", :height => "90%", :title=>"drop this class"})%>  
        <li>If you see <strong>Cancel my request to join this class</strong>, click <strong>Cancel</strong> and confirm your choice.</li>
        <%= image_tag("cancelrequest.png", {:border => 1, :width => "90%", :height => "90%", :title=>"cancel request"})%>  
        <p>
        <li>Once you've canceled your registration request, click <strong>Register</strong> to submit a new registration request for the correct section.</li>
      </ol>
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

  <%= accordion_entry :title => "I saved my free-form response, so why can't I see the multiple choice answers?" do %>
    <p>To view the multiple choice answers, you must save and <em><strong>lock</strong></em> your free form response. If you save but don't lock your free form answer, you can work on other exercises, but you won't be able to view the multiple choice answers until you save and lock.</p>
  <% end %>

  <%= accordion_entry :title => "Can I still get credit if I work exercises after the due date?" do %>
    <p><%= SITE_NAME %> will not give credit for answers entered after the due date. However, final decisions about credit for late work are ultimately up to your instructor.</p>          
  <% end %>

  <%= accordion_entry :title => "I made a mistake in my assignment. Can I fix my work and get credit?" do %>
    <p>It depends. If you saved but did <em>not</em> lock your answer, you can change your work anytime before the assignment due date.</p> 
    <p>However, if you <em>saved and locked</em> your free form or multiple choice answer, you cannot go back and change your answer.</p>
    <p>If your free form work reflects the correct multiple choice answer, and you unintentionally entered the wrong multiple choice answer, check your instructor's syllabus about their policy. Final decisions about grades are always up to the instructor.</p>
  <% end %>

  <%= accordion_entry :title => "How do I add exercises and resources to #{SITE_NAME}? It looks I can only add links." do %>
    <p>OpenStax Tutor does not host course materials. Instead you will add course materials to, or reuse content from, Connexions and Quadbase. Once your materials are hosted there, copy and paste the URL of your exercises and resources into the Topics section. 
  <%# <%= link_to "Go here to read more about adding materials to Connexions and Quadbase.", help_topics_path(:anchor => "add_content")%> </p>
  <% end %>

  <%= accordion_entry :title => "How do I add exercises to an assignment? It looks like I can only add topics." do %>
    <p>To add exercises to an Assignment, attach the topic, or topics, you want the assignment to cover. <%= SITE_NAME %> will pull exercises from the topic(s) you list, in accordance with any learning conditions set for your class. </p>

  <% end %>
  
  <%= accordion_entry :title => "My student registered for the wrong section. How can I change him to a different section?" do %>
    <p>If you are participating in a research study, <em><strong>check with the research team</strong></em> before moving a student to another section, as it may impact the student's assignments.</p>
    <p>
    <%= render :partial => 'help/blurbs/change_student_section'%>
  <% end %>

  <%= accordion_entry :title => "A student dropped my class, then changed her mind. How do I reinstate a dropped student?" do %>
    <%= render :partial => 'help/blurbs/toggle_reg_status'%>
  <% end %>
  
  <%= accordion_entry :title => "I need to override the score OST assigned to a student on an exercise. How can I do that?" do %>
    <p>At this time, there is not a way to override points taken away due to lateness or failure to view mandatory feedback. These features are coming soon. However, you can make a wrong answer correct by following these steps:</p>
    <%= render :partial => 'help/blurbs/make_correct'%>
  <% end %>


  <%= accordion_entry :title => "I sent out an assignment and realized later there is an error in one of the exercises. How do I fix it?" do %>
    <p>You may be able to edit the exercise in Quadbase and then use the <strong>Refresh Exercises</strong> feature to update the exercise. There are some limitations to this feature, though. <%= link_to_help 'refresh_exercises', text="Click here to learn more.", {:title => 'Refresh Exercises'} %></p>

      <td>This scheduler lets you schedule exercises for assignments by using portions of the exercises defined for this assignment and for previous assignments.  Arbitrary tags (labels) can be applied to each assigned exercise to cause different behavior in other parts of the learning experience (e.g. how feedback is given for particular problems).</td>

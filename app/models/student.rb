    # Our first instinct was that since auditors are not part of the formal research 
    # study, they should not be members of cohorts.  However, this means their 
    # whole OST experience would be broken (because without a cohort, they are not 
    # linked to a learning condition).  So what we do below is assign them to cohorts 
    # as we would any normal registered student.  However, when we're assigning 
    # registered students to cohorts we do not count auditing students already in 
    # cohorts; this way the cohorts will continue to have equal numbers of registered 
    # students. While not totally required, for simplicity when adding auditors we also
    # don't  count registered students. We will also continue to not include auditing 
    # students in the research reports.

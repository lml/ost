Quick Development How-To
------------------------

The best way to go is to install RVM on your machine.  Install Ruby 1.9.3 (e.g. `rvm install 1.9.3-p194`)
and install the bundler gem.  You may run into some issues where you need to install some supplemental
libraries first.

When you have RVM and bundler, fork the code and change into the ost directory.  We have a 
.rvmrc file in the top-level directory so RVM should setup things to use Ruby 1.9.3 and the 
ost gemset.

    bundle --without production
    bundle exec rake db:migrate
    bundle exec rails server
    
To upload images to questions, you'll need to have ImageMagick installed.

That's it.  You should then be able to point a web browser to http://localhost:3000.

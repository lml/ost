  # FORCE ALL THREADS TO SHARE ONE CONNECTION TO THE DATABASE
  ###########################################################
  #
  # Database transactions are determined on a per-connection basis.  Each thread (or
  # process) accessing the database establishes its own connection.
  #
  # There are two components to Capybara scenarios: "scenario steps" and the "browser".
  #
  # When Capybara runs using the :rack_test "browser", everything runs in one thread.
  # This means that the scenario steps and browser share the same database connection
  # and therefore can see each other's uncommitted database transactions. For example,
  # if a scenario step programatically adds data to the database:
  #     create_new_item(:name => "Thingy")
  # then that change is visible to the browser:
  #     visit '/item/1'
  #
  # However, when Capybara runs using any other "broswer" than :rack_test, is launches
  # the browser in a separate thread.  Now the scenario steps and browser have separate
  # database connections and therefore do NOT see each other's uncommitted transactions.
  # In the example above, the browser would get a "page not found" error because item
  # 'Thingy' doesn't exist in its database connection.
  #
  # The following code (plus a snippet in the Spork.for_each block) causes all database
  # users to share the same connection.
  #
  # IMPORTANT NOTE:
  #
  # This will NOT protect against threading issues in the scenarios themselves.  For
  # example, you have the steps:
  #    When I click on then button to create item in database 
  #    Then there should be an item in the database
  # you are introducing a potential race condition.  The second step needs to block on
  # something that tells it that the browser in the first step actually finished its
  # interactions with the database.

  # TELL CUCUMBER WHETHER OR NOT TO USE TRANSACTIONAL FIXTURES
  ############################################################
  #
  # When use_transactional_fixtures = true, Cucumber creates a new transaction 
  # for each scenario and rolls back that transaction when the scenario 
  # finishes.  This cleans up the database for the next scenario and avoids
  # order dependencies.
  #
  # When use_transactional_fixtures = false, Cucumber doesn't create transactions
  # per scenario, and some other database rollback strategy must be used.

  ####################################
  # SET THE DATABASE ROLLBACK STRATEGY
  ####################################
  #
  # As long as all threads share the same connection and use_transactional_fixtures
  # is true, we can simply use DatabaseCleaner's :transaction strategy to rollback 
  # changes made during scenarios.  Otherwise we must use :truncation.
  #
  # To ensure we start with a empty database before the first scenario, we use
  # :truncation initially.
  DatabaseCleaner.clean_with :truncation # clean once to ensure clean slate

  ########################################
  # CONFIGURE THE RAILS APPLICATION DOMAIN
  ########################################
  #
  # When our rails application starts under the :development environment, it listens
  # on http://127.0.0.1:3000 (a.k.a. http://localhost:3000).  In the :test environment under
  # Capybara, it listens on http://127.0.0.1 but with a Capybara-assigned port number.
  #
  # According to the HTTP standard, browser redirection should be done with an absolute URL,
  # not a relative path.  This means that if our rails applications thinks its domain is
  # "my.domain.com", redirect URLs will be of the form "my.domain.com/relative/path".
  #
  # When running tests, we need to tell our rails application that its domain is
  # "127.0.0.1" to prevent redirects from taking the Capybara test "browser" to an
  # external URL.  This only affects @javascript-capaable browser drivers since
  # :rack_test ignores the domain portion of the URL. 
  Ost::Application.configure do
    config.action_mailer.default_url_options     = { :host => '127.0.0.1' }

  # SET CAPYBARA DEFAULT AND JAVASCRIPT BROWSER OPTIONS
  #####################################################
  #
  # For scenarios tagged with @javascript, Capybara launches a Capybara.javascript_driver "browser",
  # which must be one which supports the execution of javascript (:webkit, :poltergeist, or :selenium).
  # Otherise, Capybara launches a Capybara.default_driver "broswer".
  #
  # The normal values are:
  #   default_driver    = :rack_test
  #   javascript_driver = :selenium
  #
  # Because of the precautions taken above w.r.t. connections, transactions and domains, we can freely mix and
  # match default and javascript drivers.

  # Sometimes we want to override this default behaviour and allow Rails to rescue
  # exceptions and display an error page (just like when the app is running in production).
  # Typical scenarios where you want to do this is when you test your error pages.
  # There are two ways to allow Rails to rescue exceptions:
  #
  # 1) Tag your scenario (or feature) with @allow-rescue
  #
  # 2) Set the value below to true. Beware that doing this globally is not
